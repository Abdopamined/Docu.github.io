        <p class="titles">The Cyberpunk Genre: A Dive into Dystopian Futures</p>
        <p>Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction that emerged in the early <sub>1980s</sub>, characterized by its focus on "high tech and low life." It explores the interplay between advanced technological developments and societal decay, often set in dystopian futures. The genre often features themes of hacking, artificial intelligence, and cybernetic enhancements, juxtaposed against gritty urban landscapes.</p>

        <p class="titles">Origins and Influences</p>
        <p>The term "cyberpunk" was coined by writer Bruce Bethke in his <sup>1983</sup> short story "Cyberpunk," but it was William Gibson's <sup>1984</sup> novel "Neuromancer" that truly defined the genre. Influences include the works of Philip K. Dick, whose stories about altered realities and artificial beings paved the way for cyberpunk's exploration of similar themes. Films like "Blade Runner" and anime like "Akira" also played significant roles in shaping the genre's aesthetic and thematic focus.</p>
